This page describes guidelines that you, as a member of the Royal Irish Regiment, must follow at all times. The general guidelines are applicable at all times, while the rest are applicable if you are in the respective servers.
<br/><br/>
Punishments given out for infractions range from taking away privileges to demotion and all the way up to a permaban. The severity of a punishment depends on the severity of the infraction. All punishments can be appealed by talking to a staff member, except of Discord mutes, which can be appealed in a seperate channel. Unfamiliarity with the guidelines does not exempt from receiving punishment.
The guidelines may change at any given moment, with prior notice sent out in the Discord server.
<br/><br/>
Additional guidelines can be found in the #the-guidelines channel on our Discord.
