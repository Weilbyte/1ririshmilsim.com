The 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment is an English milsim unit that focuses on the player's enjoyment, immersion, realism of the scenario and brotherhood between the section. 
<br/>
We do our best to create a unique gaming environment! We believe in a serious, tactical environment without any 'Sir Yes Sir' nonsense, since after all, this is still a game.
We are based in the United Kingdom but have members from all over the world.
<br/><br/>
Our unit is one based upon the British Armed Forces, where we play the role of light infantry but also host a small RAF group who fly both rotary and fixed-wing aircraft ranging from the Merlin HC4 Helicopter to the F-35 jet.
You can view the variety of gear we use by visiting our equipment page!
